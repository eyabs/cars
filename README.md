Predicting transmission types of cars, based off of weight, hp, cyl, etc

I've made a simple demonstration of using a classification tree to predict whether a car has an automatic or manual transmission.

The getCarData.R script is used by the carplots.R and carpredictions.R script to load and format the data into R for analysis.
